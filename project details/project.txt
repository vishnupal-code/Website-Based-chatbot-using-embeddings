Overview
At Humanli.ai, we build intelligent systems that transform how humans interact with
information. This assignment is designed to evaluate your ability to design and implement a
real-world AI-powered retrieval and question-answering system using modern LLMs,
embeddings, and vector databases.
Assignment Objective
Build an AI-powered chatbot that:
● Accepts a website URL as input
● Crawls and extracts content from the website
● Creates embeddings from the extracted content
● Allows users to ask questions strictly related to the website
● Returns accurate, context-aware answers based only on the website content
Core Requirements
1. URL Input
● User enters a valid website URL
● The system should handle:
○ Invalid or unreachable URLs
○ Empty or unsupported content gracefully
2. Website Crawling & Content Extraction
● Extract meaningful textual content from the provided URL
Must:
● Remove irrelevant sections such as:
○ Headers
○ Footers
○ Navigation menus
○ Advertisements
● Avoid duplicate content
Mandatory:
● HTML pages
3. Text Processing & Chunking
● Clean and normalize extracted text
● Split content into semantic chunks
● Chunk size and overlap should be configurable
● Maintain metadata for each chunk:
○ Source URL
○ Page title (if available)
4. Embeddings & Vector Storage
● Generate embeddings from text chunks using any embedding model
○ Examples: OpenAI, HuggingFace, SentenceTransformers
● Store embeddings in a vector database
● Vector database choice should be based on project requirements
Examples include (not limited to):
● Qdrant
● FAISS
● ChromaDB
● Pinecone
● Weaviate
● Embeddings must be persisted and reusable, not recreated on every query
5. AI Frameworks & LLM Usage
● You may use AI orchestration frameworks, including but not limited to:
○ LangChain
○ LangGraph
● You may use any LLM model:
○ Open-source or proprietary
● The chosen LLM model must be:
○ Clearly mentioned
○ Justified in the README
Prompt design must ensure:
● Answers are generated only from retrieved website content
● No hallucinated or external knowledge responses
6. Question Answering Logic
● Users can ask natural language questions
● If the answer is not available on the website, the chatbot must respond exactly
with:
“The answer is not available on the provided website.”
7. Short-Term Memory (Conversation Context)
● Implement short-term conversational memory
● Memory should:
○ Maintain context across multiple user queries
○ Be limited to the current session only
8. User Interface (Mandatory)
● Build a Streamlit-based application
The UI must allow:
● Entering a website URL
● Indexing the website
● Asking questions via a chat interface
● Viewing chatbot responses clearly
● Provide a public Streamlit application link
○ If public deployment is not possible, provide clear local run instructions
Deliverables (Mandatory)
1. GitHub Repository
● Complete source code
● Clean and modular project structure
● No hardcoded secrets
2. README.md
Must include:
● Project overview
● Architecture explanation
● Frameworks used (LangChain / LangGraph, if any)
● Which LLM model you used and why
● Which vector database you used and why
● Embedding strategy
● Setup and run instructions
● Assumptions, limitations, and future improvements
3. Streamlit Application Link
● Publicly accessible Streamlit app
OR
● Clearly documented local execution steps
Important Notes
● Answers must be strictly grounded in website content
● Hardcoded answers are not allowed
● Plagiarized code without explanation is not permitted
● Code quality, clarity, and reasoning are as important as functionality
Submission:
●Submit all the required details in below given google form
●Include README with setup instructions
